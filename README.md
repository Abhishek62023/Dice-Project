🎲 Introducing Dice Project: A Fun, Interactive Game Built with Node.js and Express.js 🎲

I'm excited to present Dice Project, a simple yet engaging web-based game that brings the classic fun of dice rolling to the digital world. Designed with sleek front-end visuals and backed by a powerful backend, this project showcases my ability to create interactive applications with modern web technologies.

What is Dice Project?
Dice Project is an interactive game where users can roll two virtual dice with a simple button tap. The dice values are randomly generated, and the sum of both dice is instantly displayed, offering a fun and engaging experience for users.

Technical Highlights:
🛠️ Built with Node.js and Express.js
The backend of the Dice Project leverages the power of Node.js and Express.js, ensuring fast, reliable interactions as users roll the dice. These technologies allow for smooth, server-side rendering and efficient request handling.

🎲 Interactive JavaScript Features
At the core of this game is JavaScript, responsible for generating random dice values and dynamically updating the display with each roll. Combined with HTML and CSS, the game delivers a visually appealing and responsive experience.

🎨 Sleek Design and Responsive Layout
The front end is designed with simplicity in mind, using CSS to create a polished and responsive layout. Whether you're on a desktop or mobile device, the dice rolling experience feels fluid and intuitive.

Why Dice Project Stands Out:
Dice Project isn't just a game—it's a demonstration of my ability to combine backend logic with front-end interactivity. The seamless integration of technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and JavaScript showcases my skills in building fun, user-friendly applications from scratch.
